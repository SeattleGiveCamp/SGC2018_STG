There's a big mismatch in how the client treats missions vs how the server treats missions. At some point I accidentally
reverted back to an old version of the database(which is the one currently included in this folder), and before I
realised what had happened the people writing the client code had already written around it, while the API was written
around the new version of the database. As a result, the client views a mission as two tasks related to the same content,
with the screen introducing the content being one task and the screen after the QR code is scanned as another, with
points being the basis of rewards. The server views missions as being collections of an unknown number of tasks with no
overlap in content between the tasks. Missions, once completed, are the basis of rewards. The info in task1 would go
into taskImgURL and taskDescr fields, and the info in task2 would go into contentURL and contentDescr fields.
